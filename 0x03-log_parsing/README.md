## About
Log parsing is the process of analyzing and extracting valuable information from log files generated by various applications, systems, or services. Logs are essential for troubleshooting, monitoring, and understanding the behavior of software and infrastructure. Parsing log files helps convert the raw data within logs into a structured format that can be easily analyzed and utilized for different purposes.
